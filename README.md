# DBD Build Generator

This web app is meant to allow players of DBD to generate semi-random builds based on limitations on things such as survivor, perks, perk traits,
and items and add ons. The thing that differentiates this from out perk randomizers is that this allows the player to filter perks based on the
specific things they do. For example, do you only want perks that display the killer's aura? You can filter for that! That said, this feature is still
being worked on and is not yet fully functional.

Also, I still need to implement this for the killer role. Right now it's only available for the survivor role.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
